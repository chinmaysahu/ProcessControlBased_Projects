# ProcessControlBased_Projects

This repo contains a few research work from my masters. 

I wrote those codes with help of my then PhD. [Dr. Kirubakran Velswamy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zfUBaFMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

It covers topic such as FOPTD model design, model parmeter tuning using optimization, controller design and it's tuning for  minimizing loss.
